                        <p>
                            Hi! My pretty girl.
 I hope u find this letter very well and I hope when ur reading this ur okay na. I offer u the song “when I was your man” by Bruno Mars. But unlike Bruno Mars, I don’t want to regret that I should've bought you flowers and held your hand. Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance. Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance. Now my baby`s dancing but she’s dancing with another man. And do all the things I should’ve dance when I was your man. 
This is me admitting my mistakes and childishness and me lowering my ego for us to grow and fix things. I want to say that I’ve been a very bad bf lately, and there is no valid reason for that. I know that you don’t deserve it, because you are very very very special not just to me but there’s mom and dad working hard to take care and to provide what u need. I am very guilty from what I did. And I don’t wanna do it again because u deserve to be loved, not hurt. I understand the doubt in ur heart because I know u may not fully recover from what I did, but I will prove to u not just by words how worth it I am. I will be more and more patient day by day for u to know that I understand you and there’s someone who’s willing stay by urside at any point of ur life.
 Yebba once said “And all the times you wasn't chosen, well, I'll make it up to you. All of the feelings you're not showing, when your river's overflowing.” This is me saying I’ll make it up to you for all the times you were overlooked. I know you’re holding in a lot of feelings, even though it’s hard. I’m here to support you as you let them out. I will always be your best friend, I will not judge you, and I am always on your side.
Me as your ex-bf doesn’t deserve to be loved by you yet you still made me feel loved at any moments of my life. You always support me, taught me how to love, correct me when I was wrong, and showed me your inner child and how comfortable u are to me. I am very thankful for you, and I am so lucky that I met you. I am the boy who I am today because of u, mylove.

                        </p>  
                        <strong>Love, Ex-Boyfriend.</strong>
